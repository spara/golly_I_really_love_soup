# Golly, I really love soup

This is a chrome extension that replaces

* Trump
* President
* 2016 

wtih, "Golly, I really love soup" for, you know, self care.

This is a fork of [milllenials to snake people](https://github.com/ericwbailey/millennials-to-snake-people)

You can build the extension using npm with [crx](https://github.com/oncletom/crx) but ultimately the extension will need to be distributed through the Google Chrome Web Store or it will eventually be disabled by the Chrome browser.

You can get the [extension here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/golly-i-love-soup/hbadanciihjnenchconjgiobikpcckoi)
