# Golly, I really love soup

This is a chrome extension that replaces

* Trump
* President
* 2016 

with, "Golly, I really love soup" for, you know, self care.

After looking a social media for a bit, I've expanded it to do the following:

* 'alt-right' now corrects to 'racists'
* 'Steve Bannon' now corrects to 'Steve Bannon, anti-semite,'

This is a fork of [milllenials to snake people](https://github.com/ericwbailey/millennials-to-snake-people)

You can build the extension using npm with [crx](https://github.com/oncletom/crx) but ultimately the extension will need to be distributed through the Google Chrome Web Store or it will eventually be disabled by the Chrome browser.
